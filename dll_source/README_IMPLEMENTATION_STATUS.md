# ZeroMQ DLL Implementation Status

## Current State: SOURCE CODE ONLY

### ✅ Completed:
- Full C++ source code for DLL
- MT4 compatible string handling  
- Thread-safe implementation
- MQL4 include files
- Example EAs and scripts
- Build configuration files

### ❌ Not Completed:
1. **DLL Compilation** - No compiled `mt4zmq.dll` file
2. **Dependencies** - ZeroMQ libraries not installed
3. **Build Environment** - MinGW toolchain not available
4. **Testing** - Cannot test without compiled DLL
5. **Integration** - Cannot use in MT4 without DLL

## What Would Need to Happen:

### Option 1: Local Windows Build
```powershell
# On Windows with Visual Studio:
1. Install vcpkg
2. vcpkg install zeromq:x86-windows
3. Open Visual Studio
4. Create Win32 DLL project
5. Add source files
6. Build as Release x86
```

### Option 2: Cross-Compilation
```bash
# On Linux with proper setup:
1. Install MinGW-w64
2. Install ZeroMQ dev files
3. Cross-compile for Win32
4. Test DLL on Windows
```

### Option 3: Use Existing Solution
Instead of building from scratch, use proven solutions:

- https://github.com/AustenConrad/ZeroMQ-MT4

## The Reality:

We have created a **blueprint** for a ZeroMQ DLL, but not a working implementation. To actually use it:

1. **Need Windows Dev Environment** - Visual Studio or MinGW
2. **Need ZeroMQ Libraries** - 32-bit Windows builds
3. **Need to Compile** - Create actual DLL file
4. **Need to Test** - Verify it works in MT4

## Current Workaround:

Without the DLL, we fall back to:
```
MT4 → File/Pipe → Python Bridge → ZeroMQ → Subscribers
```

Instead of the intended:
```
MT4 → DLL → ZeroMQ → Subscribers
```

## Conclusion:

The implementation is **architecturally complete** but **not functionally complete**. It's like having blueprints for a house but not the actual house.
